# Health-expenditure-analysis

Project Report - annotated-Team_Vizperers_HCEA.pdf

Jupyter notebook file - Team_Vizperers_HCEA.ipynb

<b>Motivation</b> - 
This project is critically important and intriguing due to its focus on addressing healthcare inequality, a fundamental issue in global health. By employing data visualization techniques to illuminate disparities in healthcare access, particularly for marginalized populations, the project provides a data-driven basis for policy and decision-making. <br> The project's innovative approach in handling complex healthcare data through visualization not only makes the findings accessible to a broader audience but also sets a new standard for effective communication and utilization of healthcare data.<br>
Enhance the user's understanding of global healthcare financing sources, trends, disparities, and patterns, providing insights into top-performing countries, financing structures, and economic influences. <br>
To derive valuable insights into how different countries, regions, and income groups allocate resources to healthcare, the relationship between economic development and sources of funding, and ultimately contribute to informed decision-making in the healthcare domain. <br> <br> <br>

Based on the research questions, I have implemented few data visualizations: <br>

<b>Research question 1 :  </b>Which are the top 10 countries from the dropdown that exhibit the highest
healthcare expenditure in a selected year? <br>

<b>●Line Plot </b><br>


<b>Research question 2 : </b>How has current healthcare expenditure per capita changed in the United States compared to population growth? <br>
<b>●Bar Plot</b> <br>


<b>Research question 3 :</b> What percent of the total current healthcare expenditure does the government and private sources contribute in the year 2020 for all the countries? <br>
<b>●Bubble Chart </b><br>

<b>Research question 4 : </b>How much does the government spend on schemes based on Income level per capita? <br>

<b>●Dot Visualization on Map </b><br>


<b>Research question 5 : </b>How have health spending trends changed over the years in different parts of the world? <br>

<b>●Line Graph  <br>●HeatMap </b><br>

<b>Research question 6 : </b>How does health expenditure vary across income groups within different regions, and what changes have occurred from 2010 to 2020? <br>

<b>●SunBurst Charts </b><br>

<b>Research question 7 :</b> How has the evolving relationship between purchasing power parity and exchange rates expenses worldwide since the year 2000 impacted global economic dynamics? <br>

<b>●Spider Chart </b><br>

<b>Research question 8 :</b> How does the hierarchy and proportion of healthcare financing sources vary across different countries? <br>
