<b>Motivation</b> - 
This project is critically important and intriguing due to its focus on addressing healthcare inequality, a fundamental issue in global health. By employing data visualization techniques to illuminate disparities in healthcare access, particularly for marginalized populations, the project provides a data-driven basis for policy and decision-making. <br> The project's innovative approach in handling complex healthcare data through visualization not only makes the findings accessible to a broader audience but also sets a new standard for effective communication and utilization of healthcare data.<br>
Enhance the user's understanding of global healthcare financing sources, trends, disparities, and patterns, providing insights into top-performing countries, financing structures, and economic influences. <br>
To derive valuable insights into how different countries, regions, and income groups allocate resources to healthcare, the relationship between economic development and sources of funding, and ultimately contribute to informed decision-making in the healthcare domain. <br> <br> <br>

Based on the research questions, I have implemented few data visualizations: <br>

Research question 1 : Which are the top 10 countries from the dropdown that exhibit the highest
healthcare expenditure in a selected year? <br>

Line Plot Insights : <br>
For the selected year 2020:
● The top 10 countries with the highest current healthcare expenditure per capita in 2020 are: United States, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Iceland, Canada, Belgium, UK, Republic of Korea, Portugal, Qatar <br>
● The country with the highest current healthcare expenditure per capita in 2020 is the United States with an expenditure of $11.70241K <br>
● The country with the lowest current healthcare expenditure per capita in 2020 is Qatar with an expenditure of $2188. <br> <br>

Research question 2 : How has current healthcare expenditure per capita changed in the United States compared to population growth? <br>
Bar Plot Insights : <br>
● It shows that with the increasing population in the US, the current healthcare expenditure
increases too from $4532 to $11.07K. <br>
● There is a positive relationship between population and healthcare spending. <br> <br>
